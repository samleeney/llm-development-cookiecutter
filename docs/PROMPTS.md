<!-- EXAMPLE PROMPTS - CUSTOMIZE THESE FOR YOUR PROJECT -->

## Starting a Feature
"I want to implement user authentication with email/password. Review the architecture and suggest an approach."

## Code Generation
"Create a data validation module that checks CSV files for missing values and type mismatches, following CONVENTIONS.md"

## Testing
"Write comprehensive tests for the authentication module, covering edge cases like SQL injection attempts and rate limiting"

## Debugging
"Help debug this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'user' of undefined at AuthContext.js:42"

## Code Review
"Review the data_processor.py file for consistency with project conventions and potential performance issues"

## Documentation
"Update documentation for the completed CSV import feature, including API endpoints and error codes"

## Refactoring
"Refactor the dashboard component to improve rendering performance and reduce re-renders"

## Architecture Decisions
"Should we use REST or GraphQL for our API? Consider our need for real-time updates and complex data relationships"

## Performance Optimization
"Profile the data import process and suggest optimizations. Current baseline: 10MB file takes 30 seconds"

## Security Review
"Review the authentication flow for security vulnerabilities, particularly around token storage and session management"
