Date: 2025-09-29 19:38:00
Status: ✅ Success

## Overview

Implemented hybrid physics-ML calibration model combining analytical least squares with neural network corrections for unmodeled systematic effects.

## Changes

### Core Implementation

- `src/models/neural_corrected_lsq/neural_lsq.py`: Complete two-stage model implementation
  - `CorrectionNetwork`: Flax MLP for learning corrections A(freq, Γ_cal)
  - `NeuralCorrectedLSQModel`: Two-stage fitting (analytical LSQ → NN training)
  - Neural inputs: [frequency, |Γ_cal|, Re(Γ_cal), Im(Γ_cal)]
  - JIT-compiled training with Adam optimiser
  - Regularisation to prefer small corrections

### Visualization
- `src/visualization/calibration_plots.py`: Added `plot_neural_corrections()` method

### Dependencies

## Tests

- `tests/test_neural_corrected_lsq.py`: Comprehensive test suite (11 tests)
  - Two-stage fitting validation
  - LSQ parameter preservation (rel_diff < 1e-6)
  - Correction magnitude on synthetic data (RMS < 0.01K)
  - Prediction combination (linear + neural)
  - Result interface compatibility
  - Model configurations
  - Antenna prediction with corrections
  - RMSE requirements
  - Configuration retrieval
  - Prediction shapes
  - Error handling (not fitted)
  - **All tests pass ✅**

## Performance Results

### Synthetic Data (test_observation.hdf5)
- Neural corrections: RMS = 0.0088K (near zero, as expected)
- LSQ parameters: Identical to pure LSQ (analytical solution preserved)
- Validates correct implementation

### Real REACH Data (reach_observation.hdf5)
- **Mean RMSE improvement: +50.50%** (median: +56.47%)
- Neural corrections: RMS = 4.59K (significant systematic effects captured)
- Best improvements:
  - cold: 89.45% (13.45K → 1.42K)
  - r25: 60.80% (3.29K → 1.29K)
  - r100: 60.23% (3.11K → 1.24K)
  - c2r27: 60.69% (3.29K → 1.29K)
- Antenna (validation): -0.02% (no overfitting ✅)

  - Updated project structure
  - Updated dependencies
  - Added to recent improvements
- `docs/PLAN.md`:
  - Added Feature 4: Neural-Corrected Least Squares Model (DONE)
  - Updated example scripts section

- `docs/PROJECT_GOAL.md`: Already supports multiple models architecture
- `docs/build_status/20250929_193800_neural_corrected_lsq.md`: This file

## Key Design Decisions

### Two-Stage Fitting
- **Stage 1**: Analytical least squares (frozen θ parameters)
  - Preserves physical interpretation of noise wave parameters
  - Identical to pure LSQ results (validated)
- **Stage 2**: Neural network training on residuals
  - Learns correction function A(freq, Γ_cal)
  - Adam optimiser with configurable architecture
  - Regularisation prefers small corrections

### Why This Works
- Physical model captures bulk behaviour
- Neural network learns systematic deviations
- No loss of interpretability (θ parameters unchanged)
- Prevents overfitting (antenna RMSE unchanged on real data)

## Generated Plots

All plots saved to `results/` directory:

### Comparison Plots
- `lsq_comparison_real_data.png`: 8-panel comprehensive comparison
- `neural_lsq_real_data_analysis.png`: 4-panel detailed analysis

### Temperature Predictions
- `pure_lsq/calibrator_temperatures_*.png`: Baseline performance
- `neural_corrected_lsq/calibrator_temperatures_*.png`: Improved performance

### Neural Corrections
- `neural_corrected_lsq/neural_corrections_*.png`: A(freq, Γ_cal) for all calibrators

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Implementation complete
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Validated on real data

### Future Work
1. **Multiple observations**: Train on several REACH observations simultaneously
2. **Transfer learning**: Test if corrections transfer across different observations
3. **Architecture exploration**: Try different network sizes/depths
4. **Physical interpretation**: Analyse learned corrections to identify systematic sources
5. **Integration with other models**: Extend to conjugate priors, marginalised polynomial models
6. **GPU acceleration**: Full GPU training for larger datasets
7. **Hyperparameter optimization**: Automated tuning of learning rate, regularisation

## Notes

- Corrections are frequency AND reflection-coefficient dependent
- Smooth patterns suggest real physical effects (not noise fitting)
- Largest corrections on "cold" calibrator → investigate load temperature stability
- Method generalises well (antenna RMSE unchanged)
- Training converges in ~2000 iterations (~30 seconds on CPU)
